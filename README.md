ChatStream
A React-based chat application with integrated video calling and video streaming features, powered by Firebase for user authentication and data storage.

ChatStream is a dynamic communication platform that allows users to chat, make video calls, and stream videosâ€”all in one app. Powered by Firebase, it provides secure user authentication, real-time media sharing, and seamless data storage. Built with React, TalkStream is designed to offer an intuitive, responsive experience for connecting through various media formats.

Technology Choices:

React: Provides a component-based, responsive UI structure.
Firebase: Ensures secure, real-time updates for authentication and data storage, perfect for low-latency communication.

Future Plans: Expand video streaming to include multi-user streaming rooms, improve user experience with chat themes, and introduce more media options (e.g., file sharing, screen sharing).
